[Intro]
Gonna tell you da story
Of a Reggae Shark

[Verse 1]
There are hundreds of Sharks livin' under da sea
Great Whites, Hammerheads and White Tip Reefs
But the one shark discovery always leave out
Is the dreadlock Rasta fish I'm talkin' about

[Chorus]
Reggae Shark!
Reggae Shark is real
Reggae Shark!
Him got a band with the seals
Reggae Shark!
He don't want to harm ya
Reggae Shark!
He just want your ganja

[Verse 2]
After dark Reggae Shark come cruisin'
Some say Reggae Shark's part human
Him was cursed by an evil Jelly Witch
Didn't have no reason, she was just a bitch

Some kids were boatin' and smokin' a spliff
Reggae Shark swam over to ask for a hit
The kids start screamin' and one of them drowned
Now the sheriff and his posse gonna hunt him down

[Chorus]
Reggae Shark got no political agenda
Reggae Shark!
He just wants redemption
Reggae Shark!
And he also wants ganja
But you can't light a spliff when you live underwater

[Verse 3]
One day a drug boat had to drop its load
Reggae Shark come along and him eat it whole
Now he's starvin' like marvin', got the munchies
Then him see the evil sheriff and all his flunkies
He put his fins in the air and said "It wasn't me fault!"
But the sheriff said "fire" and the rifles shot

But it was just a shark decoy tied to a raft
Cus the Reggae Shark's a master of da arts and crafts
Reggae Shark!
He jumped on the boat
And the sheriff fell down his throat
The townspeople cheered and said "You brought us peace
You took a bite of corruption in the town police"
They threw him a huge ticker tape parade
Cus they know that he balances the food chain

[Outro]
They gave him the key to Kingstontown
You should see the tourism he brings in now
"You redeemed yourself" said the Jelly Witch
Me can reverse that curse and grant your wish
Him looked at the witch and he say "nay"
Cus I'm a Reggae Shark and that's the way I'll stay!"
Reggae Shark (Reggae Shark, Reggae Shark)
Reggae Shark (Reggae Shark, Reggae Shark)
The key of Awesome
